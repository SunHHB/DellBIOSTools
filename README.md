üöÄ Quick Build (Recommended)


To create a standalone EXE without worrying about Python setup:





1. Download this repo as ZIP and extract it.
2. Double-click:

    builddellbiostools.bat

3. The script will:
   - Check if Python is installed
   - If missing, install it automatically
   - Upgrade pip and install PyInstaller
   - Compile DellBiosTools.pyw into a standalone EXE
   - Embed the custom icon from the icon folder (if present)
   - Rename the EXE with a timestamp so Windows Explorer always shows the correct icon
   - Place the finished EXE in the project folder

When it finishes, you‚Äôll see something like:

    DellBiosTools.exe

in the same folder. ‚úÖ

üîß Manual Build (Advanced)

If you prefer to build manually:

1. Install Python 3.12+ from:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
   (Check ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù during install)

2. Open Command Prompt in this repo folder.

3. Upgrade pip and install PyInstaller:

   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install pyinstaller

4. Build the EXE:

   pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon icon\DellBiosTools.ico DellBiosTools.pyw

5. The EXE will appear at:

   dist\DellBiosTools.exe

6. (Optional) Clean up temporary build files:

   rmdir /s /q build
   rmdir /s /q dist
   del DellBiosTools.spec
